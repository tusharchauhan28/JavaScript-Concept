Functions and Inbuilt function:
Introduction
Functions are a fundamental concept in programming that allow developers to encapsulate reusable pieces of code to perform specific tasks. They play a crucial role in making code more modular, readable, and maintainable. In this set of notes, we explore the concept of functions, their usage, and the importance of documentation in understanding built-in functions.

Detailed Explanation
What is the concept? Functions in programming are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They encapsulate logic and can accept input parameters and return output. Functions can be invoked (called) multiple times, enabling code reusability and modularity.

Why is it useful? Functions offer several benefits:

Modularity: Code is organized into manageable chunks, enhancing readability and maintenance.
Reusability: Functions can be called multiple times, reducing code duplication.
Abstraction: Developers can focus on what a function does rather than how it's implemented, promoting a higher level of abstraction.
Scoping: Functions create their own scope, preventing naming conflicts and promoting encapsulation. Real-world examples or analogies Just like a recipe in a cookbook, functions contain a set of instructions to accomplish a specific task. Each time you bake a cake, you follow the same recipe, emphasizing the reusability aspect of functions. Similarly, in an organization, different departments handle specific tasks (functions), such as HR for hiring, Finance for budgeting, etc.
Suppose , we have wrote the code for calculating the sum of two numbers, calculating the difference of two numbers and calculating the multiplication of two numbers in single file.

When I execute the code file, all the three code will execute but What if I want only to run Addition code or subtraction code only.

I need some tool through which I able to control the different block of code.

For Example :

In Amazon , there are different functionalities implemented like Showing products, Adding/Deleting to cart, Orders, perform payments, etc.

Every functionalities was written separately.
In Instagram, there are different functionalities like posting the image, commenting , chatting, etc.

For each functionality, their individual code is written.
Those code execution depends upon the button you are hitting
Thus , we will going to understand HOW TO CONTROL OUR CODE ?

Therefore to achieve that we have something known as functions.
